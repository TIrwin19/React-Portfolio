    content: `Hey, I'm Trevor, a passionate full-stack developer with a love
                for rock climbing and the great outdoors. I thrive in the
                dynamic world of web development, where every line of code is an
                opportunity to create something impactful. Whether it's crafting
                elegant user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap,
                architecting robust backend systems with Node.js, Express.js,
                and SQL databases like PostgreSQL, or delving into the world of
                NoSQL with MongoDB and Mongoose, I'm always eager to push the
                boundaries of what's possible.`,

                find me scaling cliffs or exploring the wilderness. Rock
                climbing isn't just a hobby for me â€“ it's a way of life that
                teaches me perseverance, problem-solving, and the importance of
                trusting in my abilities. Much like climbing a challenging
                route, I approach every coding project with determination and a
                strategic mindset, ready to tackle any obstacle that comes my
                way.`,
