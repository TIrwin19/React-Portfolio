Once the page loads you will see a landing page. You can navigate thrue the site by using the nav bar or you can click on the bouncing learn more button. This will redirect you to the about page. The portfolio page features my six latest projects and will be updated as I complete more. Navigating to the contact page you can send me a message. Lastly, the resume page has a download button where you can download my resume.
